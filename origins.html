            <p>
                The Bronze Age (3300–1200 BCE) marks the beginning of urbanization in the Land of Israel.
                This era saw the rise of fortified cities, complex societies, and trade routes connecting
                Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Levant.

            The Hellenistic Period
        </h2>

        <p>
            After the conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE, Greek influence spread
            across the land. Cities like Caesarea were built, and Greek language and culture merged with
            local traditions.

            <p>
                In 63 BCE, Roman general Pompey conquered the region. The Jewish people faced severe oppression,
                leading to revolts such as the Great Revolt (66–73 CE) and the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–136 CE).
                This era ended with the destruction of the Second Temple.
